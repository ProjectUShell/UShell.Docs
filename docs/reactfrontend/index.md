# UShell React Frontend

## UShellLayout (NPM)

...is the idea of making the menu-structure and layout of the UShell available for other React-Apps. The aspect of generating a dynamic UI based on usecases and decentralized hosted UI componentens still remaining part of the core, but the 'look & feel' should be exposed so that the UShell can be imitated to get an external module executed 'stand alone' (maybe just for debugging reasons). When the UI components of the external module is loaded into the UShell, then the external react app will serve these seamlessly.
